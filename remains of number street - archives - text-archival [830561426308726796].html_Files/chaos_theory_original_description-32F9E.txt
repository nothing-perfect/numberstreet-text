Original Description:

Chaos Theory: The dynamical system must...
1. be sensitive to initial conditions
2. be topologically mixing
3. have dense periodic orbits

In simpler terms, exactly where you begin the system has a BIG impact on where it'll end (also known as the butterfly effect), two points will eventually end up in the same place no matter how far apart they are, and two points can suddenly go in very different directions no matter how long they're together.
